# HASH TABLES
A hash table or associative array is a popular data structure used in programming. A hash table is just a linked list (I'll get to what a linked list is later on) with a hash function. A hash function basically just takes things and puts them in different "baskets". Each "basket" is just another linked list or something else depending on how you implement it. I'll explain more details on hash tables when I show you how to implement one.

## What I learnt

- What makes a good hash function
- What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
- What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions 
in the context of a hash table
- What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
